# DND-Machine
# Based on 5th Edition Rules

This virtual assistant will allow users to create new characters (at random), generate blank character sheets to create their own, allow users to update and save their character sheets, and also has a "DiceBot" feature which allows users to "roll" the various types of die used in DnD.  Currently a work in progress.

Character generator code forked from github user cruces13 - Thank you!!! I put it in a GUI for you :)
